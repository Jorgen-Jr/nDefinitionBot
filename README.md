# nDefinitionBot

I wanted to test out how telegram bots works, so I made this little bot that give you the definition of a word through inline commands.

It should return a list with the definition for the given word.

Start typing `@ndefinitionbot` in any chat and it will show what definitions there is for the desired word. It's a fair simple bot.
